# Go Email Checker

Go Email Checker is a simple program written in Go to check the DNS records of email domains for MX, SPF, and DMARC configurations.

## Introduction

This tool reads domains from standard input and checks for the following DNS records:
- MX (Mail Exchange) records
- SPF (Sender Policy Framework) records
- DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance) records

## Installation

1. Make sure you have [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/StivVentura1/go-email-checker.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd go-email-checker
   ```
4. Build the project:
   ```sh
   go build -o email-checker main.go
   ```

## Usage

To use the email checker, run the following command and input the domains you want to check:
```sh
./email-checker
```
The program will output the results in CSV format:
```
domain,hasMX,hasSPF,spfRecord,hasDMARC,dmarcRecord
```

### Example

```sh
./email-checker
example.com
```

Output:
```
example.com,true,true,v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all,true,v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc-reports@example.com
```
